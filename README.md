# AndroAppStudy
Simple Game Android App for my kids.

The app has three main activities:
   - the main one with a counter and four buttons (reset, count, random and "Dice");

   - the activity under the "random" button shows a random number and has a fragment with a recycler view under the "Funny cats" button (you can press on ghosts too =));
   - the 3rd activity is located under the "Press and Dice" inscription and consists of three fragments:
   
                    • main with fields for choosing the players names and the bottom panel for choosing a game;
                    • tic-tac-toe game;
                    • dice game.

Hi-score of "Go to hell"  button: 3003 =)
